SMS IO
======

Parses XML files generated by the Android app "SMS Backup & Restore" and stores them in an SQLite database.

The messages can then be output as a "rich text format" file (.rtf) or an HTML file.


WinForms
--------

The application uses WinForms, due to the fact that I develop it on Linux (which does not support WPF) and the application is used on Windows by a friend.

The GUI works, but it is not a work of art :)


Compile and run on Windows
--------------------------

I have never actually compiled the project on Windows. I compile on Linux and run on Windows.

Compile in Release mode.
Copy libs/sqlite3.dll to src/transformer/bin/Release.
Copy all the binaries to Windows and run SmsIO.exe.
