SMS IO
======

Parses XML files generated by the Android app "SMS Backup & Restore" and stores them in an SQLite database.

The messages can then be output as a "rich text format" file (.rtf) or an HTML file.

WinForms
--------

The application uses WinForms, due to the fact that I develop it on Linux (which does not support WPF) and the application is used on Windows by a friend.

The GUI works, but it is not a work of art :)
